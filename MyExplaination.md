# TetrisProject
So I have created a second GameThread variable and add it to the 2nd GameArea jpanel as well to create the second player, I've also been trying to check the rotation of the block but there are so many situation that I cannot account for so I may need some more time on this. However I manage to create the random block generation system that doesn't create any dupicate block, I've also improve the interface a bit and add a pause Jframe that allows player to continue, restart or exit to the main menu when he/she clicks it. As you can also see I didn't create another package to store all the tetris shapes instead I made a 3-dimensional array to store all 7 block types as 7 two-dimensional array and a 1-dimensional color array in the GameArea constructor as well as instantiate both the shape and the color of the block in the GameArea class. All of this is of course to make it easier for me and my friend to understand. You can also notice that I changed the spawnblock method's data type into that of TetrisBlock because I want to return the values of the block to somehow display the next block before it fall. I don't know how to do that right now but I will finish this funtionality in the future. I also know that resume() and suspend() method are both deprecated but I really don't know the alternative way to pause a thread and continue it ._.
